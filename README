Prereqs:
 Python:
  Download and Install Python, version 2.4 or greater.
 Django:
  Download Django (http://www.djangoproject.com/download/)
  Install Django (http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/intro/install/)
  Verify Django is installed correctly:
   $ python -c  "import django; print django.get_version()"
   # should print the version number and exit w/o errors

Database/Models development:
 Should you change one of the models, you must delete the old table
 for that model before your change will take effect.
  $ python manage.py dbshell
  > .schema
  # shows the database schema, look for your old table
  # i.e. if the model you changed was called "Location" in the directory
  # "wheat_data", then the table is probably called 
  # "wheat_data_location".
  > drop table wheat_data_location
  # Hit Ctrl+D to exit.
