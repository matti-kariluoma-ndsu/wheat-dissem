(grep for TODOs)
div -> table for the moment, then back to div when a nice strategy is defined.
printable view, preferably the view one receives. what about h-bar breaking?
on /view/*
	text links on top to buttons, put them on side?
	(show input form when visited directly)
	locations count per datapoint (variety)
database
	LSD row... where?
	support for entries that involve multiple locations

Goal: Printable version of tabbed_view when h-bar broken
Soln 1: Move content s.t. h-bar does not break
Soln 2: Have a print-view page that shows Soln 1

Goal: Show number of locations (per row?) in tabbed_view
Soln 1: in util.py, include that data, adjust tabbed_view

Remove mean calculations that are invalid
Be able to remove locations/varieties from the report
Front Page
	See descriptions of varieties
	Compare varieties to one another
Range
	ND # use sentinels?
	MN

calculate 2-4yr avg whenever available seems to be short-circuiting
For variety-to-varioety cull non-common locales
Add to lesser subsets broken?
Dec 8 - jochum
Dec 12 - Cassselton
A/B testing for these two events?
live or screenshot?

Break the subset logic apart from the list-generation logic.

** REGRESSION ** /view/variety/ pages use the /view/location/ form
  * this causes all sorts of wierdness as when the (x) and [] are used

** REGRESSION ** /view/variety doesn't seem to be putting varieties into one group very well.

* remove 1,2,3 if no data in all
* calculate n-yr when able, don't short-circuit

* for "compare selected" checkboxes: []
  * honor selected locales? or grab all? Grab all, otherwise we are shwoing the same as last time.
  * cannot compare albany/ any other variety with multiple entries.
    * allow looking for larger of the many?
    * of course, manually delete the ones we know about atm

* make sure each print will let us know what we are looking at
* look at printable version
  <link media="print" rel="stylesheet">
* look at seeing seed sellers

* enter lsds for older data
* add a link to home/start over
* "back" button support? GET instead of POST?
* mult-year avg still culling, other wierd behavior
  * 56716, 50mi
* cut off at 3-yrs
* message if v-v union is empty, from "compare selected" button
* dropdown/add -> submit for v-v on main page
  * message if v-v union empty
* look at distance-sort instead of lexigraphical for location names
* "compare selected" should do nothing if 0 or 1 varieties are selected
  * message?
* add "All" button at top
* cols not same sized on v-v view?

* 50 mi 58501, 2010, Kidder County has an index of -1, why?

* look at un-breaking h-bar
* look at an all-data view, only showing 1-2-3 for the data

Notes from Jan 5 meeting:
zipcode to means only, distance on h
 button to view source data
 note of # locations in each  result
reimagine in terms of smartphone app
 e.g smaller screens, more drill before view

Priority queue
	Input old data, repair old
	all-field view
	only show 1,2,3-yr avg, no longer ask for 50,100,etc. 

Why does Carrington 2011 bushels_acre return 25 up to 41?
Why does Kidder County 2011 bushels_acre show up twice with different values?

future:
	sort by proximity
	UI for entering data, confirmation/error pages
	Table showing noughts for each variety x location x year data has been entered for
		mouseover to see number
A strange bug: in the compare varieities view, the data is sometimes not expunged...
