(grep for TODOs)
div -> table for the moment, then back to div when a nice strategy is defined.
printable view, preferably the view one receives. what about h-bar breaking?
on /view/*
	text links on top to buttons, put them on side?
	(show input form when visited directly)
	locations count per datapoint (variety)
database
	LSD row... where?
	support for entries that involve multiple locations

Goal: Printable version of tabbed_view when h-bar broken
Soln 1: Move content s.t. h-bar does not break
Soln 2: Have a print-view page that shows Soln 1

Goal: Show number of locations (per row?) in tabbed_view
Soln 1: in util.py, include that data, adjust tabbed_view

Remove mean calculations that are invalid
Be able to remove locations/varieties from the report
Front Page
	See descriptions of varieties
	Compare varieties to one another
Range
	ND # use sentinels?
	MN

calculate 2-4yr avg whenever available seems to be short-circuiting
For variety-to-varioety cull non-common locales
Add to lesser subsets broken?
Dec 8 - jochum
Dec 12 - Cassselton
A/B testing for these two events?
live or screenshot?

Break the subset logic apart from the list-generation logic.

** REGRESSION ** /view/variety/ pages use the /view/location/ form

* remove 1,2,3 if no data in all
* calculate n-yr when able, don't short-circuit

* add (x) for locations
* add [] for varieties, a "compare selected" button
  * honor selected locales? or grab all?

* look at un-breaking h-bar
* look at an all-data view, only showing 1-2-3 for the data

* make sure each print will let us know what we are looking at

* look at printable version
* look at seeing seed sellers
