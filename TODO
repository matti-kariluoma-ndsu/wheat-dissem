Each variety could have a scroll-over box to 
information about that particular variety.

Modern browsers support 
<link media="print" rel="stylesheet" src="file.css">

Farmers have expressed interest in seeing information about providers of
seed, phone numbers/websites and prices if possible. This would info
would be available from a hyperlink on the variety name.

We need to dredge up the old data we had and enter the LSD value, back 
to 2010.

When the user clicks the checkboxes next to the variety names, then
selects "Compare Selected" they can sometimes be brought to the 
variety-variety view, but no data is on the page. 

* "compare selected" should do nothing if 0 or 1 varieties are selected
  * show a message telling them why they can't compare 0 or 1?
  * maybe they just want to see all the location data for that variety?
		* it may confusing to have them click the variety name-as-linkt o 
		generate that view

In addition to the "Yield" "Protein Percent" "Test Weight" buttons at
the top of the page, we also need a button "All" that shows all of
those fields. This view would only show the n-yr averages to save space.

* 50 mi 58501, 2010, Kidder County has an index of -1, why?

* wierd behavior
  * 56716, 50mi

button to view source data/access the json views

reimagine in terms of smartphone app
 e.g smaller screens, more drill before view

Why does Carrington 2011 bushels_acre return 25 up to 41?
Why does Kidder County 2011 bushels_acre show up twice with different values?





** REGRESSION ** 58103 200 mi.. Barnes?
** REGRESSION ** Barlow, Brennan, Faller, Glenn in variety show two tables...

Think on database synchronization for UMN<=>NDSU. Email admin when something
happens? if unresolved after 10 days, email users?

UI for entering data, confirmation/error pages
Reminder to make the user-entry page robust (iterative), and undoable.

For the iterative upload:
	1) user uploads file
	2) preprocess, no db lookup, publish the parsed file to a webpage
	3) user hits next
	4) server goes cell by cell, returning the first error to the user
	  in the same formatted page as step 2, asks the user what to do
	  i.e. accept guess, create new, etc.
	5) repeat 4 until no errors
	6) show the user the actual entered data (page as step 2, except all
	  values pulled from the databse)
	7) a page showing recent changes with the ability to undo recent changes

4 ways to get to variety-varietie from home:
 1) mutliple select
 2) n select
 3) select > text field
 4) checkboxes

Philosphize: AJAX or fully load? LSDs can't be calculated w/o all of the
data, although we could start to populate the table.. but the subtables will 
morph while loading... desirable? it does show some sort of loading screen...

Caching has been implemented as tempory-files, some thought should be
given to memcached (a security risk?). Community hivemind says db-based
is only appreciably faster in edge cases, i.e. dedicated database machine

In-page spreadsheet requirements
* Able to paste data from Excel/Open/LibreOffice
* Ability to lock 1st row/ name column headers
* Reliance on Javascript acceptable
* Ability to render in all browsers not necessary

Secretary view needs
* Testing for multiple lines entry
* Summary of about-to-commit data at end of "are you sure" pipeline?

Notes from July 27 meeting
* Allow variety descriptions (the varieties table) to be updated
** What about protection from deletion/malicious overwrite?
* Update the main page to check for javascript, do an instant-search 
type query when the zipcode is entered (i.e. dynamic keeps the zipcode 
form on the main page)
* Fill in zipcode as typed, with name data
* Ensure newly entered varieties can show up in search

Notes from Aug 10 Meeting
* Roll up advanced search page, user manual desribing GET structure
* vareity descriptors
** externel URL(s) for now
** later use to enhance v-to-v view
* Rollout Sep 1
* JSONP for other sites to grab from DB

put /add/  in robots.txt

* Anything special so google can find us?
** We need a list of keywords
*** North Dakota
*** Minnesota
*** Wheat Trials
*** Variety Varietal selection
*** NDSU MSU
*** Extension Info Type Breed Description ...

Notes from Aug 24 meeting with Dr. Wiersma
* other jump page for variety-variety if farmers want it/current 
	system confusing
* Go-ahead on the table restructure when a location is removed 
** backing off for now, it'd be easy to merge the tables, but we would
	have a hard time un-merging them, unless we could make the Table 
	class support {merge,mix}ing
* v-v wonky with caching

* was able to crash-the-cache by selecting '2010' after the 5mins
* why does the head-to-head always show -!- for one of the 1-yr means?
	is it because of my super-neat lsd code?

Investigate an appropriate time to call page.clear(), if ever -or- set
up garbage-collection __name__() functions, if exists?

need to use the urlencode filter when making /view/variety/name/ links

First conferences are in the first week of Dec

Can we make the list of other varieties a two or three column affair? is that confusing?

On the www.ag server:
p = m.Trial_Entry.objects.filter(location=m.Location.objects.filter(name="Casselton")).filter(harvest_date__in=m.Date.objects.filter( date__range=(datetime.date(max_year,1,1), datetime.date(max_year,12,31))))
p = m.Trial_Entry.objects.filter(location=m.Location.objects.filter(name="Prosper")).filter(harvest_date__in=m.Date.objects.filter( date__range=(datetime.date(max_year,1,1), datetime.date(max_year,12,31))))
for e in p:
	e.hidden = True
	e.save()

2013 Jan 11 Meeting:
* Check that /n=8/ locations are used to build a table, and more are grabbed failing that.
* css is broken, again!
** consider copying them to local? (how to realize the originals changed?)
*** can we do the same trick for local jquery load?
* 56716 -- Walsh County shows up 2x.
* 2012 LSDs not displayed... entered? tried 56716 & 58102
* Send R-script to Dr. Wiersma, detailing the multi-year LSD calculation. Use data from 55108
* Limit to /n=3/ tables.
* Move head-head back to the main page/whereever, off of the query results page
* Add disclaimer - vis. "you may use this data provided you reproduce it in its entirety"
* ensure the contribute system is disabled
* Self
** Advanced search
*** More advanced queries can be dreamt up? More powerful interaction with the URL generator?
*** CSV download of results?
** More flexible data entry - consider other crops, i.e. alfalpha is not measured in bushels_acre.

* Email updates _every_ Friday
