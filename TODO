(grep for TODOs)
div -> table for the moment, then back to div when a nice strategy is defined.
printable view, preferably the view one receives. what about h-bar breaking?
on /view/*
	text links on top to buttons, hide unused ones, put them on side?
	(show input form when visited directly)
	title pages and units blurb per page
		new row in database... lookup on field.name
	mean = None when data lacking
	locations count per datapoint (variety)
database
	LSD row... where?
	support for entries that involve multiple locations
	
Goal: Show units/blurb/title page for each field_name in tabbed_view
Soln 1: Database of VARCHAR() or urls to text files
Soln 2: Static python dict of values to pass in view.py

Goal: Printable version of tabbed_view when h-bar broken
Soln 1: Move content s.t. h-bar does not break
Soln 2: Have a print-view page that shows Soln 1

Goal: Buttons for tabbed_view links
Soln 1: See Soln 2 of units/blurb/titles

Goal: Show number of locations (per row?) in tabbed_view
Soln 1: in util.py, include that data, adjust tabbed_view

Goal: Show LSD
Problem 1: LSD data is only available per "sheet" which roughly equates
to mean yields per location x year
Problem 2: We only have LSD for yield
Problem 3: We cannot calculate LSD from our averaged data, we need raw
Problem 4: We have multiple per-calculcated LSDs when a query pulls
in data from multiple locations/years.

Remove mean calculations that are invalid
Prune empty varieties (for the current year)
Be able to remove locations/varieties from the report
