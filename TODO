<div> tags with a good class structure
to keep the data aligned. Furthermore, it may be possible to represent
the cells as objects and reduce the need for the server to explicitly
make the table structure.

The links on "tabbed_view" aren't really hyperlinks to other pages, they
use javascript to reload the page with new parameters. This won't work 
if javascript is disabled. Also, would an image hyperlink, or some other
method, be more clear then a text hyperlink?

Each variety should have a hyperlink (ideally a scroll-over box) to 
information about that particular variety.


LSD_Calculator.fetch() is really three functions, one where sub-tables 
are generated, one where lsds for those sub-tables are calculated, and
another where everything is collated into an output table. The latter
step (collated into output table) for sure needs to be cut out into
a separate method, and all three are candidates for client-side 
processing.

Someone will need to implement "LSD(list[][], alpha):" in javascript.

The intent of this website is to replace the printed booklets that
the Plant Sciences dept currently prints and distributes. They already
have pdf versions of their booklets available on the website, and our
project would like to deliver in a form familiar to that. Modern

browsers support <link media="print" rel="stylesheet" src="file.css">

It seems the html/css does not keep all of the columns the same size.
We should try to make them all the same width.

If we use divs instead of tables, we can't (?) control line breaks.
Looked at Display:Inline, white-space:nowrap but did not help! Maybe we 
need to have our design allow for a newline in our table? color, shading?

Farmers have expressed interest in seeing information about providers of
seed, phone numbers/websites and prices if possible. This would info
would be available from a hyperlink on the variety name.

When the project first began, we entertained the idea of calculating the
LSD of varieties at some location from raw data. Turns out we only have
aggregate data availbale, for the foreseeable future. We need to dredge
up the old data we had and enter the LSD value, back to 2010.

Each page should have a link to the homepage (to start the query over).
This should be in base.html.

When the user clicks the checkboxes next to the variety names, then
selects "Compare Selected" they can sometimes be brought to the 
variety-variety view, but no data is on the page. It would be best if
their was some sort of message to be shown to the user; problem is
if we use a ResponseRedirect, we can't (?) do a render_to_response()
to show that message.

* "compare selected" should do nothing if 0 or 1 varieties are selected
  * show a message telling them why they can't compare 0 or 1?
  * maybe they just want to see all the location data for that variety?
		* it may confusing to have them click the variety name-as-linkt o 
		generate that view

In addition to the "Yield" "Protein Percent" "Test Weight" buttons at
the top of the page, we also need a button "All" that shows all of
those fields. This view would only show the n-yr averages to save space.


Implement listing the locations in the url in terms of what has been removed, 
rather than what is being displayed. In views.py in tabbed_view the locations 
that have been removed are stored in the lost neg_locations

* 50 mi 58501, 2010, Kidder County has an index of -1, why?

* wierd behavior
  * 56716, 50mi

Notes from Jan 5 meeting:
zipcode to means only, distance on h
 button to view source data
 note of # locations in each  result
reimagine in terms of smartphone app
 e.g smaller screens, more drill before view

Priority queue
	Input old data, repair old
	all-field view
	only show 1,2,3-yr avg, no longer ask for 50,100,etc. 

Why does Carrington 2011 bushels_acre return 25 up to 41?
Why does Kidder County 2011 bushels_acre show up twice with different values?

future:
	sort by proximity
	UI for entering data, confirmation/error pages
	Table showing noughts for each variety x location x year data has been entered for
		mouseover to see number

** REGRESSION ** in the compare varieities view, the data is sometimes not expunged...

Notes from 2012-Mar-20 Meeting
	*	H-bar gone in some browsers?
	* Remove empty locations (feature for Jochum) on extension version, keep on 134
	* Display (how?) the number of site-years in each avg calc
		* need to give the view the length of the 1,2,3-yr list
		* footnote?
	* Fix up the transition from variety-location views
		* send the string "variety" or "location"?
	* Don't mind as much about across site-years, we want big tables
		* maybe do calcs like as now, then collate them into one or more tables?
		* "inivisibly" drop locations to calculate 3,2-yr lsds
** REGRESSION ** 58103 200 mi.. Barnes?
** REGRESSION ** Barlow, Brennan, Faller, Glenn in variety show two tables...


Notes from 2012-May-18 Meeting

Talk of how we are going to truncate tables for pretty output.
	1) when calculating subsets, only show those with greater than 6-10 varieties 
		and 4-5 locations
	2) From the zipcode, search for locations in a wideneing radius until the 
		above criteria are met.
	3) For the variety-variety view, repeat the above.
	

If we are going to have access the zipcode at all times, and ditching radius,
maybe our get paramters can be locations deselected instead? and variety-variety
views can just be up inthe get bar, since it'll be small? I'd like to have
a list of numbers, or failing that reduce "varieties=" to "v=" (worse solution)

Think on database synchronization for UMN<=>NDSU. Email admin when something
happens? if unresolved after 10 days, email users?

Reminder to make the user-entry page robust (iterative), and undoable.

If python is still losing references in early July, we'll need to investigate
a new language. Before that we must try the new classes for variety_trials_util
and maybe ask the community about a particualr version/implementation (JPython,
CPython, IronPython, etc.) and see if that helps.

Is it worthwhile to use some other project/library to render our html/
route pages/handle forms?

For the iterative upload:
	1) user uploads file
	2) preprocess, no db lookup, publish the parsed file to a webpage
	3) user hits next
	4) server goes cell by cell, returning the first error to the user
	  in the same formatted page as step 2, asks the user what to do
	  i.e. accept guess, create new, etc.
	5) repeat 4 until no errors
	6) show the user the actual entered data (page as step 2, except all
	  values pulled from the databse)
	7) a page showing recent changes with the ability to undo recent changes

BUG
1) choose zipcode from home
2) remove a location
3) click one of the 'yield,protein,...' or '2012,2011,...' breaks it

4 ways to get to v-v from home:
 1) mutliple select
 2) n select
 3) select > text field
 4) checkboxes

Pass objects to the page (dynamic pageview); first we'll need classes in 
javascript to store our data (or get it on each call with json... maybe that
is more acceptable). http://www.phpoed.com/3-ways-to-define-a-javascript-class/

Chew on spaghetti: AJAX or fully load? LSDs can't be calculated w/o all of the
data, although we could start to populate the table.. but the subtables will 
morph while loading... desirable? it does show some sort of loading screen...
