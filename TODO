Each variety could have a scroll-over box to information about that particular variety.

Modern browsers support 
<link media="print" rel="stylesheet" src="file.css">

Farmers have expressed interest in seeing information about providers of
seed, phone numbers/websites and prices if possible. This would info
would be available from a hyperlink on the variety name.

We need to dredge up the old data we had and enter the LSD value, back 
to 2010.

* "compare selected" should do nothing if 1 variety is selected
  * maybe they just want to see all the location data for that variety?
		* it may confusing to have them click the variety name-as-link o 
		generate that view

In addition to the "Yield" "Protein Percent" "Test Weight" buttons at
the top of the page, we also need a button "All" that shows all of
those fields. This view would only show the n-yr averages to save space.

button to view source data/access the json views

reimagine in terms of smartphone app
 e.g smaller screens, more drill before view

Think on database synchronization for UMN<=>NDSU. Email admin when something
happens? if unresolved after 10 days, email users?

UI for entering data, confirmation/error pages
Reminder to make the user-entry page robust (iterative), and undoable.

For the iterative upload:
 1) user uploads file
 2) preprocess, no db lookup, publish the parsed file to a webpage
 3) user hits next
 4)	server goes cell by cell, returning the first error to the user
		in the same formatted page as step 2, asks the user what to do
		i.e. accept guess, create new, etc.
 5) repeat 4 until no errors
 6)	show the user the actual entered data (page as step 2, except all
		values pulled from the databse)
 7) a page showing recent changes with the ability to undo recent changes

4 ways to get to variety-variety from home:
 1) mutliple select
 2) n select
 3) select > text field
 4) checkboxes

Philosphize: AJAX or fully load? LSDs can't be calculated w/o all of the
data, although we could start to populate the table.. but the subtables will 
morph while loading... desirable? it does show some sort of loading screen...

Caching has been implemented as tempory-files, some thought should be
given to memcached (a security risk?). Community hivemind says db-based
is only appreciably faster in edge cases, i.e. dedicated database machine

In-page spreadsheet requirements
* Able to paste data from Excel/Open/LibreOffice
* Ability to lock 1st row/ name column headers
* Reliance on Javascript acceptable
* Ability to render in all browsers not necessary

Secretary view needs
* Testing for multiple lines entry
* Summary of about-to-commit data at end of "are you sure" pipeline?

Notes from July 27 meeting
* Allow variety descriptions (the varieties table) to be updated
** What about protection from deletion/malicious overwrite?
* Update the main page to check for javascript, do an instant-search 
	type query when the zipcode is entered (i.e. dynamic keeps the zipcode 
	form on the main page)
* Fill in zipcode as typed, with name data
* Ensure newly entered varieties can show up in search

Notes from Aug 10 Meeting
* Roll up advanced search page, user manual desribing GET structure
* vareity descriptors
** externel URL(s) for now
** later use to enhance v-to-v view
* Rollout Sep 1
* JSONP for other sites to grab from DB

put /add/ in robots.txt

* Anything special so google can find us?
** We need a list of keywords
*** North Dakota
*** Minnesota
*** Wheat Trials
*** Variety Varietal selection
*** NDSU MSU
*** Extension Info Type Breed Description ...

Notes from Aug 24 meeting with Dr. Wiersma
* v-v wonky with caching

* was able to crash-the-cache by selecting '2010' after the 5mins

Investigate an appropriate time to call page.clear(), if ever -or- set
up garbage-collection __name__() functions, if exists?

need to use the urlencode filter when making /view/variety/name/ links

2013 Jan 11 Meeting:
* Self
** Advanced search
*** More advanced queries can be dreamt up? More powerful interaction with the URL generator?
*** CSV download of results?
** More flexible data entry - consider other crops, i.e. alfalpha is not measured in bushels_acre.

* Email updates _every_ Friday

* variety infos (put links in database):

* link /view/available/ to the contribute(?) section

* Include upper tables in each following table.
** Highlight new entries?

print R version, agricolae version in footer of each page. May as well print django/python as well.

Can we rewrite _get_entries() to itereate through years and directly fetch the self.cells? will need to profile both approaches
Must find a way to bacth the calls to the R subprocess, or at least async them (time for ajax?)

55108 2012 NEAR shows (8, 0, 0) for first table, but 2011 shows (8, 7, 5)...!? 
	It's beacuse of LeCenter... how are the means still calculating for 2-yr?

Explain caveats of setting variety= on advanced_search.html (does not_locations still work?, etc.)

Filter out "id" from list of fields on advanced_search.html

On many pages, no LSD results appear, and _sometimes_ a refresh causes them to appear/disappear...

UI:
* should their be a list of "locations hidden", with links to unhide them? yes?
* button to "load more locations"
* message saying which planting methods are shown on the page

head-to-head problems: 
	after doing lots&lots of queries, I conclude we have extra data in 2012 for
	only Williston and Carrington.
	Performed:
	query = models.Trial_Entry.objects.filter(harvest_date__in=this_year_dates).filter(hidden=False).filter(location=wil).filter(planting_method_tags="no till")
	>>> query.count()
	32
	>>> for e in query:
	...  e.hidden = True
	...  e.save()
	>>> query = models.Trial_Entry.objects.filter(harvest_date__in=this_year_dates).filter(hidden=False).filter(location=car).exclude(planting_method_tags=None)
	>>> query.count()
	107
	>>> for e in query:
	...  e.hidden = True
	...  e.save()

This is now approaching a problem point; We just threw away 107+32 pieces of 
data because we have no way of showing no-till vs fallow trials, etc. fix!

A new problem: I'm now seeing lsd when 3-yr is all none, it's just a copy of the 2-yr...

Planting method tags in the database:
	fallow
	no till, recrop
	direct, dryland, recrop, elite
	irrigated
	organic
	dryland
	direct
	fungicide
	no till, durum stubble
	no till
	recrop
	tilled soybean cover
	direct, fungicide
	intensive
	direct, recrop, elite

Planting method tags normalizing:
for e in  models.Trial_Entry.objects.filter(planting_method_tags=u''):
 e.planting_method_tags=None
 e.save()
e = models.Trial_Entry.objects.filter(planting_method_tags=u'no till recrop')[0]
e.planting_method_tags = u'no till, recrop'
e.save()
for e in models.Trial_Entry.objects.filter(planting_method_tags=u'foliar fungicide, variety response, main factors'):
 e.planting_method_tags = u'fungicide'
 e.save()
for e in  models.Trial_Entry.objects.filter(planting_method_tags=u'direct seeded'):
 e.planting_method_tags = u'direct'
 e.save()
for e in  models.Trial_Entry.objects.filter(planting_method_tags=u'direct seeded, dryland, recrop, elite'):
 e.planting_method_tags = u'direct, dryland, recrop, elite'
 e.save()

Planting method tags UI:
* user indicates preference on main page, defaults to none
* tags are displayed with location name.
