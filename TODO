(grep for TODOs)
div -> table for the moment, then back to div when a nice strategy is defined.
on /view/*
	text links on top to buttons, put them on side?
	(show input form when visited directly)
	locations count per datapoint (variety)

	See descriptions of varieties

Break the subset logic apart from the list-generation logic.

** REGRESSION ** /view/variety/ pages use the /view/location/ form
  * this causes all sorts of wierdness as when the (x) and [] are used

* look at printable version
  <link media="print" rel="stylesheet">
* look at seeing seed sellers

* enter lsds for older data
* add a link to home/start over
* "back" button support? GET instead of POST?
* mult-year avg still culling, other wierd behavior
  * 56716, 50mi
* message if v-v union is empty, from "compare selected" button
* dropdown/add -> submit for v-v on main page
  * message if v-v union empty
* look at distance-sort instead of lexigraphical for location names
* "compare selected" should do nothing if 0 or 1 varieties are selected
  * message?
* add "All" button at top
 * only show n-yr avgs of each field
* cols not same sized on v-v view?

* 50 mi 58501, 2010, Kidder County has an index of -1, why?

Notes from Jan 5 meeting:
zipcode to means only, distance on h
 button to view source data
 note of # locations in each  result
reimagine in terms of smartphone app
 e.g smaller screens, more drill before view

Priority queue
	Input old data, repair old
	all-field view
	only show 1,2,3-yr avg, no longer ask for 50,100,etc. 

Why does Carrington 2011 bushels_acre return 25 up to 41?
Why does Kidder County 2011 bushels_acre show up twice with different values?

future:
	sort by proximity
	UI for entering data, confirmation/error pages
	Table showing noughts for each variety x location x year data has been entered for
		mouseover to see number

** REGRESSION ** in the compare varieities view, the data is sometimes not expunged...

Notes from 2012-Mar-20 Meeting
	*	H-bar gone in some browsers?
	* Remove empty locations (feature for Jochum) on extension version, keep on 134
	* Display (how?) the number of site-years in each avg calc
		* footnote?
	* Fix up the transition from variety-location views
		* send the string "variety" or "location"?
	* Don't mind as much about across site-years, we want big tables
		* maybe do calcs like as now, then collate them into one or more tables?
		* "inivisibly" drop locations to calculate 3,2-yr lsds
** REGRESSION ** 58103 200 mi.. Barnes?
** REGRESSION ** Barlow, Brennan, Faller, Glenn in variety show two tables...
